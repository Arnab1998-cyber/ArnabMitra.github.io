									<h1>Arnab Mitra</h1>
									<h3>An Artificial Intelligence, Data Science Enthusiast. A Mathematician, passionate Astronomer.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>I have a passion for science and technology since my school days. I love night sky with millions of star. During lockdown I take participated in "International Astronomy and Astrophysics Compitition" and got a rank within 20% of total participant throughout the world. Astronomy is a field where people of any field (not only physics) can contribute. I wonder how Artificial intelligence can change our whole universe.</p>
								<p>From self driving car to robotic surgery. AI is everywhere now. Our whole world can be considered as a neural network and the fuel of the network is Data. This is a data driven world. From this thought, my data science journey has been started. In Robotic Surgey, Segementation algorithm is used and the machine has been trained on over thousands of segmented images. Similarly in astronomy, object detection model can be used for searching EXO-PLANETS.<br>
								I love to build application in Machine learning and Deep Learning. I have made several application in this field, some of which you can see in previous page. I have master degree in mathematics. Now it's time for applying my knowledge in machine learning algorithms. I am working as a data science intern in a company. My objective is to build a system which can solve many business problem.</p>
